# Enterprise-Chat-system
As a part of our project, we have to develop an Enterprise chat system. It is expected to help
the employees of an organisation to communicate safely. The name of the chat system is "CHAT EXPRESS" A central database is developed which
stores the metadata of the sent and received messages for the users to browse chat history easily.
The users can also track if the message which they have sent has been seen by the receiver or not
including the time. The user can set up their status (Available or busy) based on their interest.
Furthermore, for security purposes users have to create a username and password to authenticate
themselves. The data given by the users while creating their usernames is stored in central
database. Finally, this product is developed to be a secured chat system and secures confidential
data against 3 rd party security breaches.
